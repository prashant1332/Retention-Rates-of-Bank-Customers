      <h1> Retention Rates of Bank Customers</h1>

# Description
The aim of this machine learning project is to develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression to estimate the retention rates of bank customers. The project focuses on understanding the factors that influence customer retention in the banking industry to enable the bank to take proactive measures in retaining valuable customers and reducing churn.  To achieve this, we will gather historical customer data that includes various features such as customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, occupation), account information (type of account, balance, tenure), transaction history, credit score, customer interactions, product usage, communication preferences, and previous churn history.  Logistic Regression is chosen as the appropriate machine learning algorithm for this project because it can predict the probability of a binary outcome, in this case, whether a customer will churn (1) or not churn (0). By analyzing the relationship between customer features and churn, the model will provide valuable insights into the significance of each feature in influencing customer retention.
